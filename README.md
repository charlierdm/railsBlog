# railsBlog

For the next 2 weeks at Makers Academy, we are learning and using Rails to serve a social media app as a group. This is a personal repo for me to consolidate what I learn about rails and to experiment with new features that take my interest. 

## Personal Goals

* To be able to set up and serve an app using Rails. 

* To effectively test drive each part of my Rails app.

* To learn how React integrates with the Rails framework.

* To feel confident using a feature rich web appication framework having learnt web app development using Sinatra. 

## Learning Rails

Here I will document some of the key learning points during my introduction to the Rails Framework.

* I have Rails set up with RSpec for test driving and a 'Hello world' on the index page.
